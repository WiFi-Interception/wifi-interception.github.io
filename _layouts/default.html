				<h1>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks without Rogue AP: When WPAs Meet ICMP Redirects</h1>
				<div class ="boxed">
					<p> Modern Wi-Fi networks are commonly protected by the security mechanisms, e.g., WPA, WPA2 or WPA3, and thus it
						is difficult for an attacker (a malicious supplicant) to hijack the
						traffic of other supplicants as a man-in-the-middle (MITM). In
						traditional Evil Twins attacks, attackers may deploy a bogus
						wireless access point (AP) to hijack the victim supplicants'
						traffic (e.g., stealing credentials). In this paper, we uncover a
						new MITM attack that can evade the security mechanisms
						in Wi-Fi networks by spoofing the legitimate AP to send a
						forged ICMP redirect message to a victim supplicant and thus
						allow attackers to stealthily hijack the traffic from the victim
						supplicant without deploying any bogus AP. The core idea is
						to misuse the vulnerability of cross-layer interactions between
						WPAs and ICMP protocols, totally evading the link layer security
						mechanisms enforced by WPAs. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>We resolve two requirements
						to successfully launch our attack. First, when the attacker
						spoofs the legitimate AP to craft an ICMP redirect message,
						the legitimate AP cannot recognize and filter out those forged
						ICMP redirect messages. We uncover a new vulnerability of the
						Network Processing Units (NPUs) in AP routers that restrict the
						AP routers from blocking fake ICMP error messages passing
						through the router. We test 55 popular wireless routers from 10
						well-known AP vendors, and none of these routers can block
						the forged ICMP redirect messages due to this vulnerability.
						Second, we develop a new method to ensure the forged ICMP
						redirect message can evade the legitimacy check of the victim
						supplicant and then poison its routing table. We conduct an
						extensive measurement study on 122 real-world Wi-Fi networks,
						covering all prevalent Wi-Fi security modes. The experimental
						results show that 109 out of the 122 (89%) evaluated Wi-Fi
						networks are vulnerable to our attack. Besides notifying the
						vulnerability to the NPU manufacturers and the AP vendors,
						we develop two countermeasures to throttle the identified attack.

										<li class="answer"> &#9733  We develop a new technique in Wi-Fi networks to evade the legitimacy checks of supplicants on the received ICMP redirect messages
										<li class="answer"> &#9733  we demonstrate that ICMP redirects can be exploited to evade security features (even WPA3) of Wi-Fi networks to perform a MITM attack without a rogue AP or complicated cracking.

									</ul>
								</p>
							<b> What is the threat model?</b>
								<p class="answer">
									Figure 1 illustrates the threat model of our man-in-themiddle (MITM) attack. The AP encrypts the network traffic of its supplicants via the security mechanisms developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance. The security mechanisms enforced by the AP can be WPA2 or WPA3. Accordingly, the security mode used by the AP can be WPA2-Personal, WPA2-Enterprise, WPA3-Personal, or WPA3-Enterprise. A victim supplicant (e.g., a mobile phone or a laptop) is attached to a public wireless AP to access remote servers on the Internet. The attacker is a malicious supplicant with no particular demands for the hardware or software. We assume the attacker can access the same AP in both personal mode and enterprise mode before launching our MITM attacks to hijack the traffic sent from the victim supplicant to the remote server.</p>

								</div>
							<b> How does the attack work?</b>
								<p class="answer">
									Figure 2 presents the three steps of our attack. At the beginning, the traffic originating from the victim supplicant tothe remote server is sent to the AP and encrypted by a session key between the AP and the victim. The attacker may sniff the encrypted frames, but it cannot decrypt the packets without knowing the session key. In the first step of the attack, by leveraging the ICMP Destination Unreachable Message [14] that is unimpeded in Wi-Fi networks, the attacker focuses on probing the target Wi-Fi network to identify an exploitable UDP port on the victim supplicant. In the second step, the attacker crafts an ICMP redirect message embedded with a fake UDP header (carrying the probed open UDP port) to poison the victim supplicant’s routing. In the third step, the attacker evades WPAs and hijacks the victim supplicant’straffic in plaintext at the link layer. In the following, we elaborate the three steps.</p>

							<b>What devices can be compromised by this attack?</b>
								<p class="answer">
								We conduct extensive real-world evaluations to measure the impacts of our attack. We first investigate if vulnerable APs can block crafted ICMP redirect messages issued from an attacker to a victim supplicant. We test 55 popular wireless routers in our lab and find that none of these routers can block forged ICMP redirect messages. Next, we evaluate our attack against the security mechanisms of WPA2 and WPA3 in both IPv4 and IPv6 Wi-Fi networks, respectively. We evaluate 122 real-world Wi-Fi networks and discover that 109 (89%) of them may suffer from our MITM attack.</p>
